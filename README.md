**MovieFans** is a dynamic and interactive React application designed for movie enthusiasts who want to explore and engage with a vast collection of movies. The app offers a variety of features for both casual users and registered members.

For users who are not authenticated, the app provides the ability to browse through an extensive selection of movies and read reviews created by other users. These visitors can also take advantage of sorting, filtering, and pagination options to customize their browsing experience. However, their interaction with the content is limited to viewing only.

Once a user creates an account and logs in, a whole new set of features becomes available. Authenticated users can not only view movies but also create, edit, and delete their own movie entries. They have the ability to leave ratings and write detailed reviews for each movie. Additionally, these users have access to dedicated pages where they can manage the movies and reviews they have personally contributed.

The app is divided into several key directories: components, API, hooks, contexts, and utils. This structure ensures a clean, maintainable codebase by dividing functionality and responsibilities clearly across different areas of the project.
